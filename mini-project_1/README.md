# Can I Place N Flowers?

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

Example 1:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
```

Example 2:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
```

### How to compile
```bash
make run
```

### How to run test
```bash
make test
```

### How to debug the program
```bash
gcc -g name_of_file.c -o name_of_file
gdb name_of_file
```

#### How to start the Program
* break main
* run - Execute the program
* next - Next Line
* print &i - Print the address of the variable
* print sizeof(int) - Print sizeof the int type
* x/4xb &i - Get the raw bytes of i. I want to examinate 4 values formatted as hex numerals. byte by byte
* ptype i - Tell me the type of c expression
* x/12xb &a - a is an array

### Linking stuff and generating the program

If you have modules you have to compile one by one
```bash
gcc -c module1.c # This command generates module1.o
gcc -c program-that-depends-of-module1.c
gcc -o program.out module1.o program-that-depends-of-module1.o
./program.out
```
